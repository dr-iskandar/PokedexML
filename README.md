# PokedexML
## A side project app to test out Apple's New CreateML framework

### Overview



### Technologies Used
* CreateML
* CoreML
* Vision
* AVFoundation
* AlamoFire
* CoreAnimation


This app was created by using CreateML to make a custom model to identify the first three generations of pokemon starters as well as Pikachu. I was curious to see how well the image recognition of CoreML's Vision framework was in combination with the custom model made from around 20 pictures per pokemon. This app also allowed me to practice making an API request to pokeapi.co and parsing through the JSON response.
